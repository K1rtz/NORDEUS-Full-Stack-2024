###Game description
After loading the page, you can start by selecting the avatar you want to play as. 
Next, choose the difficulty level. Higher difficulty reduces the number of colors and lives, making it harder to estimate the height of each cell and increasing the game's challenge.
Below the difficulty options, you'll find a legend that maps each color to a height range, helping you interpret the map.
Below the legend, thereâ€™s a task display in green, which provides updates on your current objective in the game.
On the right side of the screen is the main game display.
Below both the task display and the main game display is the levels section,consisting of 12 levels. The game is completed either by successfully finishing 
all levels (victory) or losing all lives before completing the final level (defeat).

The character is controlled with the ARROW KEYS, and eggs are placed using the SPACEBAR.
